# HandyScripts

### ðŸ“Œ Disclaimer (Don't Judge)

##### I was just **learning** and these are just practice scripts ðŸ§ª

- This repository contains a collection of Python scripts written during my learning phase and exploration of various programming concepts.

- The code may include rough implementations, incomplete features, or inconsistent styles, as it's intended for experimentation and self-improvement, not production use.

- Some scripts were written while exploring new libraries, tools, or problem-solving techniques, so they may lack documentation, error handling, or optimal structure.

- Use at your own discretion. Contributions, suggestions, or corrections are always welcome as part of the learning journey!
